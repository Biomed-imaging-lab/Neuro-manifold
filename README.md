# Neuronal Activity Estimation with Manifolds

This repository contains the code and analysis pipeline for the research presented in the paper: "AI-powered mice behavior tracking and its application for neuronal manifold analysis based on hippocampal ensembles activity in Alzheimerâ€™s disease mice model"

The study investigates the use of manifold learning techniques to analyze neural activity in the hippocampus of mice, with a focus on identifying features associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

## Repository Structure

* `manifold_with_tracking.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the primary experimental workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, manifold construction, analysis, and visualization.
* `manifold_manager.py`: Provides a class using various teaching methods (PCA, ICA, the, MAP, DS) used in the study.
* `data_manager.py`: Provides a class for preprocessing raw neural activity data. This includes temporary aggregation and formatting of the data.
* `rating_manager.py`: Provides a class for calculating the main numeric parameters of the received manifolds.

##  Usage

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vainmoon/neuronal_activity_estimation_with_manifolds.git
    cd neuronal_activity_estimation_with_manifolds
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Run the main experiment notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook manifold_with_tracking.ipynb
    ```
